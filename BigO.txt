Big O

Big O time is the language and metric we use to describe the efficiency of algorithms.
We need to understand this concept to be able to judge if our algorithms are getting faster or slower.

Inside the parenthesis, the relationship between the input and the steps taken by the algorithm is presented using "n".

The following are some of the most common Big-O functions:

Constant	O(c)
Linear	O(n)
Quadratic	O(n^2)
Cubic	O(n^3)
Exponential	O(2^n)
Logarithmic	O(log(n))
Log Linear	O(nlog(n))
